# Computational Chemistry For Experimentalists
This free repository of worked examples complements the material in my textbook "Computational Chemistry for Experimentalists", available at https://shop.elsevier.com/books/computational-chemistry-for-experimentalists/janesko/978-0-443-34211-0 . Examples are a mix of Jupyter notebooks using PySCF and the RDKit, Python scripts using PySCF, and Gaussian 16 input and output files. Several of the examples include practice problems to help sharpen your understnding.
