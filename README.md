# Computational Chemistry For Experimentalists
This repository includes "computational labs" intended to teach topics in computational chemistry, molecular simulation, and related areas. Most labs are provided as Jupyter notebooks. 

Special Instructions for TCU Users: To run a jupyter notebook on hpcl1, launch google-chrome from the head node, and submit the batch job juptyer-notebook.slurm. Once the job is running, look in the output file juptyer-notebook-JOBID.out for the line "copy and paste one of these URLs". Copy and paste the URL into chrome, then navigate to the desired notebook.
