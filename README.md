# Computational Chemistry For Experimentalists
This free repository of worked examples complements the material in "Computational Chemistry for Experimentalists", available at https://shop.elsevier.com/books/computational-chemistry-for-experimentalists/janesko/978-0-443-34211-0 . Each example treats material from one chapter. Examples are a mix of open Python platforms (PySCF) and Gaussian 16.
