# Computational Chemistry For Experimentalists
This free repository of worked examples complements the material in my textbook "Computational Chemistry for Experimentalists", available at https://shop.elsevier.com/books/computational-chemistry-for-experimentalists/janesko/978-0-443-34211-0 . Examples are a mix of Jupyter notebooks (PySCF and the RDKit) and Gaussian 16. Several of the examples include practice problems to help sharpen your understnding.
